/**
 * One port's entry in the architecture dispatch: a {@link java.util.ServiceLoader} service each
 * port module registers (META-INF/services), so {@link Models} finds exactly the ports on the
 * classpath - no hand-maintained arch table in every consumer.
 *
 * <p>A port declares its {@link #architectures()} and overrides the {@code load*} method of each
 * kind it can produce - language, embedding, reranker, speech, transcription. The others keep their
 * default, which refuses with the architecture's name. All five take the same picture of the model:
 * the {@code channel} holding the bytes, the parsed {@code gguf} (whose tensor offsets are absolute
 * in that channel - an embedded GGUF arrives as {@link GGUF#at(long)}), the {@code path} of the
 * file on disk (the GGUF itself, or the archive holding it: the loaded model's name, and where a
 * port looks for a sibling file), and the {@code arena} the weights are mapped into (who provides
 * the arena owns the weights' lifetime; it must outlive every model sharing them). Nothing here is
 * sized by context: a state's size is chosen at {@code newState}, and the model's own context
 * length comes from the GGUF.
 *
 * <p><b>WARNING: confined arenas MUST NOT be supplied to any loading method. Misuse can corrupt
 * memory or crash the JVM; a confined arena is refused at load.</b> Even one worker may run on a
 * custom pool's thread or native pthread other than the arena's owner. Raw-address kernels bypass
 * JDK confinement checks. See {@link com.qxotic.jinfer.Arenas} for the memory contract.

     *       projector, a draft head, a pronunciation lexicon. It has no meaning without its model
     *       and is not independently loadable.
     *   <li>Named by CAPABILITY, attached EXPLICITLY by the caller - never discovered, never
     *       guessed. The capability is what a user asks for; the filename is this port's business
     *       (and how a downloader finds it).
     *   <li>Loaded BY THE PORT, into the model's own arena; how is the port's business, and it is
     *       not cached or preloaded - a companion header parse costs ~10 ms.
     *   <li>Its BYTES JOIN THE CACHE SEED ({@code Models.load} does this), because a companion
     *       changes what the model computes - cached KV must be keyed by it.
     * </ol>
     *
     * <p>And what a companion is NOT: not a tokenizer (that is the text-to-ids codec OUTSIDE the
     * computation, passed as the {@code tokenizer} argument), and not a model.

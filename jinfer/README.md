`jinfer` stands for "**J**VM **Infer**ence": a low-level AI inference engine for the JVM.  
No sidecar process, Docker containers, Python, ONNX or HTTP requests involved.  
AI on the JVM, just a Maven dependency away.

## Highlights

- **Multimodal support.** Vision, audio, video, embeddings for RAG, text-to-speech, speech-to-text.
- **Supports popular Java AI frameworks.** [LangChain4j](jinfer-langchain4j/README.md) and
  [Spring AI](jinfer-spring-ai/README.md) providers and an [OpenAI-compatible server](./jinfer-server).
- **Top performance.** Efficient prompt caching, speculative decoding, Matryoshka embeddings and optional hand-tuned native kernels from [JAM](../jam), with a performant Vector API fallback.
- **Constrained generation.** Models can only emit tokens that follow the specified schema.
- **First-class support for GraalVM's Native Image.** Self-contained binaries with millisecond startup.

Supported quantizations: `Q4_0`, `Q5_0`, `Q4_K`, `Q5_K`, `Q6_K`, `Q8_0`, `MXFP4` and the dense `F32`, `F16`, `BF16`.  
Jinfer recommends `Q8_0` for its balance of quality and performance.

## Run the demos

The demos and examples use [JBang](https://www.jbang.dev/).

```bash
cd jinfer/examples/scripts

jbang Chat.java "Invent a tiny language for talking to houseplants."   # streaming text
jbang Json.java "Ada Lovelace, born 1815 in London."                   # schema-perfect JSON
jbang Narrate.java photo.jpg                                           # vision, then speech
jbang Detect.java street.jpg "person, bicycle, traffic light"          # annotated PNG
```

Start with `Chat.java`, which downloads a 1B model. `Detect.java` uses a 12B vision model, so
expect a longer download. The [full gallery](examples/scripts/README.md) also covers semantic
search, reranking, logic puzzles and prompt-cache accounting.

## Use it from Java

Import the BOM once:

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.qxotic</groupId>
      <artifactId>jinfer-bom</artifactId>
      <version>0.3.0</version>
      <type>pom</type>
      <scope>import</scope>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

Add one API binding and one model family (`jinfer-models-all` for all model architectures):

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.qxotic</groupId>
  <artifactId>jinfer-langchain4j</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.qxotic</groupId>
  <artifactId>jinfer-lfm2</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

To spawn and use a model:

```java
try (var model = JinferChatModel.builder()
        .model("LiquidAI/LFM2.5-350M-GGUF:Q8_0")
        .build()) {
    System.out.println(model.chat("What is the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything?"));
}
```

A model reference is defined as `[provider.com/]owner/repository[@revision][/path][:quant]`, downloaded once from Hugging Face and cached.  
Other providers and hosts are supported, for example `modelscope.cn/Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF:Q8_0`.
Use `.modelPath(Path modelPath)` to specify a model file already on disk.

Run with `--add-modules jdk.incubator.vector --enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED`, and add
`jam-native` at runtime scope to accelerate matrix multiplications.  
If native libraries cannot be used/loaded, use `jam-vector` instead to accelerate matrix multiplications, this provides a pure Java execution, end-to-end.

## Examples

The snippets below use the [LangChain4j](jinfer-langchain4j) integration. The [Spring AI](jinfer-spring-ai/README.md) integration covers the same features.
For the `AiServices` examples, also add `dev.langchain4j:langchain4j:1.19.0` to your dependencies.

**Streaming.**

```java
interface Assistant { TokenStream chat(String message); }

Assistant assistant = AiServices.create(Assistant.class, model.streaming());

assistant.chat("Tell me a haiku about rivers.")
        .onPartialResponse(System.out::print)
        .onError(Throwable::printStackTrace)
        .start();
```

**Structured output.** The generation is constrained to the schema, so the result cannot come back
malformed:

```java
record Person(String name, int age, String city) {}

interface PersonExtractor { Person extract(String text); }

Person p = AiServices.create(PersonExtractor.class, model)
        .extract("Johann is 42 and lives in Munich."); // Person[name=Johann, age=42, city=Munich]
```

To constrain the output to a specific shape instead of a POJO, pass a [GBNF grammar](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/master/grammars/README.md):

```java
var response = model.chat(ChatRequest.builder()
        .messages(UserMessage.from("Extract the person as JSON: " + text))
        .parameters(JinferChatRequestParameters.builder().grammar(GRAMMAR).build())
        .build());
```

**Tool calling.**

```java
class Weather {
    @Tool("Current weather for a city")
    String weather(@P("city") String city) { return "18C, sunny in " + city; }
}

interface WeatherAssistant { String chat(String message); }

WeatherAssistant assistant = AiServices.builder(WeatherAssistant.class)
        .chatModel(model)
        .tools(new Weather())
        .build();

assistant.chat("What's the weather in Zurich?");   // calls weather("Zurich"), then answers
```

**Vision.** Multimodal models attach their encoder as a companion, following llama.cpp's `mmproj`
convention:

```java
try (var gemma = JinferChatModel.builder()
        .model("unsloth/gemma-4-12b-it-GGUF:Q8_0")
        .companion("media", "unsloth/gemma-4-12b-it-GGUF/mmproj-F32.gguf")
        .build()) {

    var answer = gemma.chat(UserMessage.from(
            ImageContent.from(Path.of("photo.png").toUri()),
            TextContent.from("What is in this picture?")));

    System.out.println(answer.aiMessage().text());
}
```

Media is decoded locally and projected into embeddings. `jinfer` does not fetch media during
inference.

**Embeddings and reranking.** No vector service or reranking endpoint is required.

```java
EmbeddingModel embeddings = JinferEmbeddingModel.builder()
        .model("Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B-GGUF:Q8_0")
        .build();

ScoringModel reranker = JinferScoringModel.builder()
        .model("mradermacher/Qwen3-Reranker-0.6B-GGUF:Q8_0")
        .build();
```

**Prompt caching.** Prefill a long system prompt once and reload it after a restart:

```java
JinferChatModel support = base.withCachedPrompt(List.of(SystemMessage.from(INSTRUCTIONS)), tools);

support.chat("How do I reset my password?");   // the instructions are already in the KV cache
base.saveCachedPrompts(Path.of("personas.jkv"));
```

**Speculative decoding.** Models that ship a draft head (e.g. Gemma 4, Qwen 3.5) can attach it as the
`speculation` companion:

```java
try (var gemma = JinferChatModel.builder()
        .model("unsloth/gemma-4-E2B-it-GGUF:Q8_0")
        .companion("speculation", "unsloth/gemma-4-E2B-it-GGUF/MTP/mtp-gemma-4-E2B-it-Q8_0.gguf")
        .build()) { ... }
```

This provides a speed-up only when the draft head guesses well, and that depends on the text, not the model.
Measured on Gemma 4 E2B Q8_0 on a 16-core CPU: lists 2.0x, code 1.7x, prose 0.9x; chat prose on a Q4_K_M checkpoint fell to 0.4x.

**Text-to-speech.**

```java
try (var speech = JinferSpeechModel.builder()
        .model("remixerdec/Inflect-Nano-v2-GGUF:Q8_0")
        .companion("lexicon", "remixerdec/Inflect-Nano-v2-GGUF/lexicon.bin")
        .build()) {

    var audio = speech.synthesize("Hello from local Java inference.").audio();

    Files.write(Path.of("hello.wav"), audio.binaryData());
}
```

**Speech-to-text.** Transcription with word timing, faster than realtime on the CPU:

```java
try (var transcriber = JinferTranscriptionModel.builder()
        .model("mudler/parakeet-cpp-gguf/tdt-0.6b-v3-q8_0.gguf")
        .build()) {

    System.out.println(transcriber.transcribe(Path.of("speech.wav")).text());
}
```

The same model behind the CLI's `transcribe` command handles audio files, while `server` serves an
OpenAI-compatible `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions` (multipart; `response_format` of `json`,
`text`, or `verbose_json` with word timestamps).

**Streaming transcription.** Feed audio as it arrives and poll the evolving transcript; text
behind the commit horizon no longer changes, and `finish()` equals the offline transcript:

```java
try (var state = parakeet.newState(); var stream = parakeet.stream(state)) {
    while (capturing) {
        stream.feed(nextPcmChunk);
        display(stream.partial().text());
    }
    System.out.println(stream.finish().text());
}
```

Or from a microphone straight through the CLI, live partials on stderr:

```bash
ffmpeg -nostats -loglevel error -f avfoundation -i ":0" -ar 16000 -ac 1 -f s16le - \
  | jinfer -m parakeet.gguf transcribe - --raw-pcm
```

On a terminal the partials render as one status line updated in place; redirected stderr gets one
line per partial instead, so scripts can follow along.

## Chat CLI

To test different models, a simple CLI is bundled, can chat with all the supported models.
It is published as a single executable jar, so [JBang](https://www.jbang.dev/) runs it without a
checkout, in this mode and in the server, transcription and speech synthesis modes:

```bash
jbang jinfer@qxoticai chat --model LiquidAI/LFM2.5-350M-GGUF:Q8_0
```

From a checkout, build it and run the jar:

```bash
mvn -pl jinfer/jinfer-cli -am package -DskipTests

java \
  --add-modules jdk.incubator.vector \
  -jar jinfer/jinfer-cli/target/jinfer.jar \
  --model LiquidAI/LFM2.5-350M-GGUF:Q8_0 \
  chat
```

## Text-to-speech CLI

Use `speak` with a speech model and `--output` to write a 16-bit PCM WAV:

```bash
jbang jinfer@qxoticai -m remixerdec/Inflect-Nano-v2-GGUF:Q8_0 \
  speak "Hello world." --output hello.wav --speed 1.2

jbang jinfer@qxoticai -m simonfxr/kokoro.cpp-GGUF/kokoro-82m-q8_0.gguf \
  --with voice=simonfxr/kokoro.cpp-GGUF/voices/kokoro-voice-af_heart.gguf \
  speak "Hello from Kokoro." --output kokoro.wav
```

Local model and companion paths work too.
Kokoro requires a `voice` companion; Inflect2 optionally accepts a pronunciation lexicon via `--with lexicon=<path|ref>`.
`--speed` selects a positive speaking-rate multiplier within the model's supported range; omitted, it uses the model's default.
Without `--output`, speech is played after synthesis.

Use `--stream` to start playback with the first clip while later clips are synthesized:

```bash
jinfer -m inflect.gguf speak "Hello world."
jinfer -m inflect.gguf speak "Hello world. Here is the next sentence." --stream
```

Both playback modes support Linux, macOS and Windows:

| Platform | Playback backend | Requirement |
|----------|------------------|-------------|
| Linux | `aplay`, falling back to `ffplay` if unavailable | Install ALSA utilities or FFmpeg with `ffplay` |
| macOS | `afplay`, falling back to `ffplay` if unavailable | `afplay` is built in |
| Windows | Windows PowerShell's `.NET SoundPlayer`, falling back to `ffplay` if unavailable | Windows PowerShell is built in |

Streaming feeds continuous PCM on Linux; macOS and Windows play WAV clips while synthesizing one clip ahead.
Players must be available on `PATH`; a player that launches but fails reports its error.
Choose playback or `--output`; they cannot be combined.
Use `--stream` to enable streaming or `--no-stream` to disable it; these switches take no values.

`speak -` reads UTF-8 text from stdin, and `--output -` writes WAV bytes to stdout, with diagnostics on stderr:

```bash
jinfer -m inflect.gguf speak - --output - < story.txt > story.wav
```

The same flags work with the executable jar shown above.

## OpenAI-compatible server

A simple OpenAI-compatible server is also provided.  
Multimodal models can attach their audio/image projector with `--with media=<clip.gguf>`. Pass `--help` for more details.

```bash
mvn -pl jinfer/jinfer-cli -am package -DskipTests

java \
  --add-modules jdk.incubator.vector \
  -jar jinfer/jinfer-cli/target/jinfer.jar \
  --model LiquidAI/LFM2.5-2.6B-GGUF:Q8_0 \
  --context-capacity 65536 \
  server
```

The server runs by default at `localhost:54154`, to verify it works:
```shell
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:54154/v1/chat/completions \
    -d '{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}]}'
```

### Structured output

Chat Completions accepts `response_format` with type `text`, `json_object`, or `json_schema`.
For `json_schema`, the server describes the schema in a system instruction and constrains the generated answer with a grammar.
The question itself need not mention JSON or name the fields.
The instruction applies to the final answer, so tools can still be called before answering.
Schema support follows `Grammar.fromSchema`'s supported subset; `strict: true` does not enable unsupported JSON Schema keywords.

```shell
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:54154/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}],
    "temperature": 0,
    "max_tokens": 256,
    "reasoning_effort": "none",
    "response_format": {
      "type": "json_schema",
      "json_schema": {
        "name": "capital",
        "strict": true,
        "schema": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {"city": {"type": "string"}},
          "required": ["city"],
          "additionalProperties": false
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

For `/v1/responses`, use `text.format: {"type":"json_schema","name":"capital","strict":true,"schema":{...}}` and `max_output_tokens`.
Both APIs support streaming structured output.
In `json_object` mode, a system or user message must explicitly request JSON.

A token budget can interrupt a document before it is valid JSON.
Chat Completions reports `finish_reason: "length"`; Responses reports `status: "incomplete"` with `incomplete_details.reason: "max_output_tokens"`, and streams `response.incomplete` as its terminal response event.
Check termination before parsing partial output; typed SDK parsers may raise when a document is incomplete.

## GraalVM Native Image

```

One self-contained binary, instant startup. Requires GraalVM Native Image 25.0.3+.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **`jinfer` does not use `jota`'s Tensor API**, instead, it uses `jota`'s low-level memory APIs, which also supports CuTe nested layouts and strong encapsulation, but without multi-backend kernel generation.  
> The first `jinfer` prototype was written using the Tensor API but could only get up to ~70%-90% of the tokens/s compared to hand-written kernels.  
> To achieve this already sub-par performance, the code used the Tensor API, but instead of pristine, beautiful code, it was rather complex and ugly; naive code using the Tensor API only reached a mere ~30%. The `jota` (tensor) compiler was no match for the hand-written kernels.  
> The transformer architecture has been optimized A LOT, the popular implementations consist of a few hand-written kernels optimized for the hardware and we already reached the point where the hardware in being optimized for the transformer.  
> No matter how many compiler tricks (and I know some) to borderline magic I poured into the jota's (tensor) compiler, I couldn't beat the hand-written kernels.  
> I just postponed the effort... I dropped the pure, beautiful approach and accepted the pragmatic complexity, all in the name of better performance.  
> Having sub-par performance for the `jinfer` MVP was a no-go, this is something that cannot be hidden under the _"JVM is safe, thus slower"_ carpet. I decided to go with the hand-written kernels and drop GPU supports for now.
> I still have hope, that the Tensor API could be re-introduced gradually later on in `jinfer`. There are some components that are performant using the pristine Tensor API with a decent (tensor) compiler.  
> **Advice for compiler hobbyists:** If you are designing, implementing, or planning to, a tensor DSL or programming language for accelerators or custom hardware ... top performance **requires** access to the hardware in a specialized way e.g. via intrinsics, escape hatches, dialects and custom extensions ...  there's no one true language/DSL, portability and performance hardly come together. The one language/DSL to rule them all, is only a fantasy. This is obvious, but sometimes we get blinded by biases and hubris; don't.
